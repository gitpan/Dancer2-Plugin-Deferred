NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Deferred - Defer messages or data across redirections

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
      use Dancer2::Plugin::Deferred;

      get '/defer' => sub {
        deferred error => "Klaatu barada nikto";
        redirect '/later';
      }

      get '/later' => sub {
        template 'later';
      }

      # in template 'later.tt'
      <% IF deferred.error %>
      <div class="error"><% deferred.error %></div>
      <% END %>

DESCRIPTION
    This Dancer2 plugin provides a method for deferring a one-time message
    across a redirect. It is similar to "flash" messages, but without the
    race conditions that can result from multiple tabs in a browser or from
    AJAX requests. It is similar in design to
    Catalyst::Plugin::StatusMessage, but adapted for Dancer2.

    It works by creating a unique message ID within the session that holds
    deferred data. The message ID is automatically added as a query
    parameter to redirection requests. It's sort of like a session within a
    session, but tied to a request rather than global to the browser. (It
    will even chain across multiple redirects.)

    When a template is rendered, a pre-template hook retrieves the data and
    deletes it from the session. Alternatively, the data can be retrieved
    manually (which will also automatically delete the data.)

    Alternatively, the message ID parameters can be retrieved and used to
    construct a hyperlink for a message to be retrieved later. In this case,
    the message is preserved past the template hook. (The template should be
    sure not to render the message if not desired.)

USAGE
  deferred
      deferred $key => $value;
      $value = deferred $key; # also deletes $key

    This function works just like "var" or "session", except that it lasts
    only for the current request and across any redirects. Data is deleted
    if accessed. If a key is set to an undefined value, the key is deleted
    from the deferred data hash.

  all_deferred
      template 'index', { deferred => all_deferred };

    This function returns all the deferred data as a hash reference and
    deletes the stored data. This is called automatically in the
    "before_template_render" hook, but is available if someone wants to have
    manual control.

  deferred_param
      template 'index' => { link => uri_for( '/other', { deferred_param } ) };

    This function returns the parameter key and value used to propagate the
    message to another request. Using this function toggles the
    "var_keep_key" variable to true to ensure the message remains to be
    retrieved by the link.

CONFIGURATION
    *   "var_key: dpdid" -- this is the key in the "var" hash containing the
        message ID

    *   "var_keep_key: dpd_keep" -- if this key in "var" is true, retrieving
        values will not be destructive

    *   "params_key: dpdid" -- this is the key in the "params" hash
        containing the message ID

    *   "session_key_prefix": dpd_> -- the message ID is appended to this
        prefix and used to store deferred data in the session

    *   "template_key: deferred" -- this is the key to deferred data passed
        to the template

    Thank you to mst for explaining why Catalyst::Plugin::StatusMessages
    does what it does and putting up with my dumb ideas along the way.
